This error message indicates that the file-loader module is missing from your project's node_modules directory. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

Check if file-loader is listed as a dependency in your project's package.json file. If it is not listed, you can add it as a dependency by running the following command in your project directory:
css
Copy code
npm install --save-dev file-loader
If it is listed, proceed to step 2.

Try deleting the node_modules directory and re-installing all dependencies by running the following commands in your project directory:
bash
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
Check if the path specified in your code for the file-loader module is correct. Make sure that the path is relative to your project's root directory and that the module is installed in the correct location.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you may want to try updating your version of file-loader to the latest version by running the following command:

css
Copy code
npm install --save-dev file-loader@latest
I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions!
