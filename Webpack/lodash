npm install lodash
Wait for the installation process to complete.
Once the installation is complete, you can start using Lodash in your JavaScript code by including the following line at the top of your file:

javascript
Copy code
const _ = require('lodash');
Alternatively, if you are using ECMAScript modules, you can use the following syntax:

javascript
Copy code
import _ from 'lodash';
That's it! You should now be able to use Lodash in your JavaScript code.
