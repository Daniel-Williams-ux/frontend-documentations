Favicons, short for "favorites icons", are small icons that represent a website. 
They are typically displayed in a web browser's address bar, next to the website's URL, as well as in bookmarks and on tabs.

Favicons help to visually identify a website, making it easier for users to find and recognize it. 
They also add a professional touch and can help to brand a website.

To use a favicon on a website, you can add the following code to the head of your HTML file:

**<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="path/to/favicon.png">**

The href attribute specifies the location of the favicon image file, and the type attribute specifies the type of image file (in this example, a PNG file). 
The rel attribute is used to define the relationship between the current document and the linked resource. 
The value "icon" specifies that the linked resource is an icon.

Note that the specific code and attributes used for a favicon may vary depending on the type of image file being used and the specific 
requirements of different browsers.
