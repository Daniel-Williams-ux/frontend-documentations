## **head tag**
The head tag element contains all the metadatas related to your page. All the elements put in the head are not visible in the window of the browser.

A lot of metadatas exist, some specific to some CMS.

Usage
You can find inside the head:

title of the webpage
asynchronous script calls
metadata
CSS code embed (critical CSS)
JavaScript code embed

Valid <head> elements include meta, link, title, style, script, noscript, and base.

These elements provide information for how a document should be perceived, and rendered, by web technologies. e.g. browsers, search engines, bots, etc.

  Can you explain the meaning of this code? <meta 
            name="description" 
            content="Techium is a digital agency">
  
  The HTML code <meta name="description" content="Techium is a digital agency"> is used to provide a brief description of a web page.

The name attribute with the value "description" specifies that this meta tag is providing a description of the page, and the content attribute provides the actual description text. In this case, the description text is "Techium is a digital agency".

Search engines often display the meta description in their search results, so it's important to provide a concise and descriptive summary of the page's content. This can help improve the click-through rate (CTR) of the search result, as it provides more context and information to users about what the page is about.
