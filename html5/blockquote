  <p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low
  throughput, and low altitude service.  The
  connection topology is limited to a single
  point-to-point path for each carrier, used with
  standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
  without significant interference with each other,
  outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D
  ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
  to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3.  The carriers
  have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which
  increases availability.</p>

  <p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
