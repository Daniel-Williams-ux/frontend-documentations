## **HTML tag**
The <html> HTML tag tells the browser that the document is an HTML webpage. It is used as a container for all the HTML elements.

Warning!

The doctype is the only element living outside the html tag.

<html lang="fr" dir="ltr">
  
The dir attribute with value "ltr" (left-to-right) is used to specify the text direction for the contents of an HTML element. 
  It tells the browser which direction the text within the element should be displayed in. In this case, 
  the value "ltr" specifies that the text should be displayed from left-to-right, as is commonly used in Western languages such as English.

In contrast, the value "rtl" (right-to-left) is used for text in languages that are read from right-to-left, such as Arabic or Hebrew. 
This attribute is especially important for ensuring that the text is displayed correctly in multilingual pages or in pages containing elements in different scripts 
or languages.
