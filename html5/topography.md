## **Text/Typography**
A long list of HTML tags are used to give semantic meaning to specific text. Each tag is essential to help users and browsers understand the specificity of a certain portion of text. It’s crucial to understand which can be used in which situation.

<em> to indicate stress emphasis.
<i> to indicate text set off from the normal prose (foreign word, technical term…).
<strong> to indicate stronger importance.
<b> to draw attention to specific content (keywords in a summary, product names in a review…).
<small> to represent side-comments or small text (copyright, legal text…).
<del> to represent a text that has been deleted.
<ins> to represent a text that has been inserted.
<s> to render text with a strikethough or a line through it.
<wbr> to specify where the text could have a line-break.
<mark> to indicate relevance, representing text marked or highlighted for reference.
<cite> to mark the name of a work, such as a book, play, or song.
<dfn> to mark the defining instance of a term.
<abbr> to represents an abbreviation or acronyme.
<code> to indicate at short fragment of computer code.
<time> to indicate a specific period in time.
<address> to indicate contact information (person, people or organization).
Warning!

Some tags like <strong> and <b> may look the same visually in your browser. Please remember that HTML is about content, semantics, and not the visual aspect.
