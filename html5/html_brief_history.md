## **HTML**
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.

Brief history
In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext, 
which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. 
The IETF began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. 
In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later.
HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.

At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004. 
Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML continued: the two organizations released the first draft of HTML5 in 2008 and an official standard in 2014. 
The term "HTML5" is just a buzzword referring to modern web technologies which are part of the HTML Living Standard

### **Definition of Terminologies**

1. SGML
The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is an ISO specification for defining declarative markup languages.

On the web, HTML 4, XHTML, and XML are popular SGML-based languages. It is worth noting that since its fifth edition, 
HTML is no longer SGML-based and has its own parsing rules

2. ISO
ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is a global association that develops uniform criteria coordinating the companies in each major industry.

3. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a worldwide organization that drafts specifications governing the mechanisms behind the Internet, 
especially the TCP/IP or Internet Protocol Suite
