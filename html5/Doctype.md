## **Doctype**
In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYPE html>" preamble found at the top of all documents. 
Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called "quirks mode" when rendering a document; that is, 
the "<!DOCTYPE html>" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications,
rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.

The <doctype> is necessary at the top of every HTML page to force the browser to render the page according to relevant specifications.
