sh: 1: react-scripts: not found. How do I solve this?

This error message usually indicates that the react-scripts package is missing or not properly installed in your project. Here are a few steps you can follow to solve this issue:

Make sure that you have installed react-scripts as a dependency in your project by running the following command in your project directory:

css
Copy code
npm install react-scripts --save
This will install react-scripts and save it as a dependency in your package.json file.

If the package is already installed, try running the following command to reinstall it:

css
Copy code
npm install react-scripts --force
This will force npm to reinstall the package and its dependencies.

If the above steps do not work, try clearing the npm cache and then reinstalling the package:

css
Copy code
npm cache clean --force
npm install react-scripts --save
This will clear the npm cache and then reinstall react-scripts.

If none of the above steps work, there may be an issue with your npm installation or your project's configuration. You can try creating a new React project and see if react-scripts is properly installed in the new project.
